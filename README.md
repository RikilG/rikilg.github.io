# My Personal Site - on github pages

This repo is built based on pure html, css, javascript just to put my 
web development skill to test :)

This repo also contains a Markdown to Html converter built in python 
to convert my markdown notes and text into html sites for my blog.  
I have included this only because i write my stuff in markdown and 
can only be published if it is in html. [README link](MdToHtml/README.md)
